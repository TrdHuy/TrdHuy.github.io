This helps prevent the installation of malicious apps.</p><h3>⚡️Blocks commands by USB cable</h3><p>Malicious chargers, computers, and other devices won't be able to send commands to your phone when connected using a USB cable.</p><h3>⚡️Blocks malware images in messaging apps</h3><p>When you receive a message with an image that's suspected of containing malware, the image will be blocked to keep you safe.</p><h3>⚡️Blocks software updates by USB cable</h3><p>Prevent installation of system software using a USB cable. This can prevent someone with physical access to your phone from installing malicious software without your knowledge.</p></div></div><div class="_df535_5237bccc _52f79_06c4481b _77f82_be1b476f"><img src="assets/images/b0edcf38186ab0f7944c.jpg" alt="AB About" class="_a0577_c2c9ae32"/><div class="_d0bf7_d4ad10f5"><h1 class="_bd2f3_f0140d09 _f476e_ac6cae3e">Maximum protection:</h1><h3>⚡️App protection</h3><p>Apps installed on your phone will be checked for malicious activity.</p><h3>⚡️Blocks device admin apps</h3><p>Prevents device admin apps and work profiles from being activated on your tablet.

This can prevent someone else from intercepting your network traffic and personal data. You can still connect to these networks manually in Wi-Fi settings. Non-secure networks include Open, Enhanced Open, and WEP networks.</p></div></div><div class="_df535_5237bccc _52f79_06c4481b _77f82_be1b476f"><img src="assets/images/59abf5ea19c259e1c264.jpg" alt="AB About" class="_a0577_c2c9ae32"/><div class="_d0bf7_d4ad10f5"><h3>⚡️Blocks hyperlinks and previews</h3><p>Prevents preview images and hyperlinks from appearing when you receive a message that includes a web address. This helps protect you from accidentally visiting malicious websites. If you receive a message that contains a web address from someone you trust, you'll need to copy and paste or type the web address in your browser.</p><h3>⚡️Blocks shared albums</h3><p>The shared album menu isn't available, and other people can't invite you to shared albums. This protects you against invitations from people who may not be who they say they are, and it prevents you from accidentally sharing pictures that might be sensitive.</p><h3>⚡️Removes location data when sharing pictures</h3><p>When you share a picture from Gallery, location data will be removed from the picture before it's sent. This prevents the recipient from being able to determine where the picture was taken.</p></div></div></div><div class="overview-container _52f79_06c4481b"><h1 class="_bd2f3_f0140d09">Auto Blocker UI:</h1><p>The user interface of Auto Blocker is designed to be simple and user-friendly, allowing users to easily customize security settings according to their personal needs:</p></div><div class="_df535_5237bccc" style="padding:0;align-items:baseline;gap:40px;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap"><div class="_4e71d_f8b346ea"><img src="assets/images/f1a1a43696e1806365c9.jpg" alt="AB About" class="_a0577_c2c9ae32"/><div class="_d0bf7_d4ad10f5" style="min-width:400px"><h3>⚡️Security and Privacy Settings:</h3><p>Auto Blocker can be activated and customized in the Settings > Security and Privacy section on devices running One UI 6.</p></div></div><div class="_4e71d_f8b346ea" style="max-width:600px"><div class="_df535_5237bccc _77f82_be1b476f" style="padding:0"><img src="assets/images/18d271151f56cbcdd9f9.jpg" alt="AB About" class="_a0577_c2c9ae32"/> <img src="assets/images/094c4ac7ce376dc416d6.jpg" alt="AB About" class="_a0577_c2c9ae32"/></div><div class="_d0bf7_d4ad10f5" style="min-width:400px"><h3>⚡️Notifications and Alerts:</h3><p>Users receive warning notifications and the option to temporarily disable the security feature when attempting to install apps from unauthorized sources.</p></div></div><div class="_4e71d_f8b346ea"><img src="assets/images/6d93fecbc46db23945e8.jpg" alt="AB About" class="_a0577_c2c9ae32"/><div class="_d0bf7_d4ad10f5" style="min-width:400px"><h3>⚡️Security Reports:</h3><p>Provides detailed reports on blocked access attempts and installations, helping users better understand potential security threats.</p></div></div></div></body><footer><script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/ionicons@5.5.2/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js"></script><script nomodule src="https://unpkg.com/ionicons@5.5.2/dist/ionicons/ionicons.js"></script><script src="8e5dec8a45c7107628ab.js"></script></footer>
